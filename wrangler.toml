**Note:** The log also suggests a `wrangler.jsonc` file, which is an alternative format. The `.toml` format is more common.

#### 2. Modify the Deploy Command

If you prefer a quicker, one-time fix without a configuration file, you can modify your deploy command to point directly to the assets directory.

Change your deploy command from:
`npx wrangler deploy`

to:
`npx wrangler deploy --assets=./dist`

This command explicitly tells Wrangler to deploy the contents of the `dist` directory. You will likely need to update this in your deployment platform's build settings or in your `package.json` script.
